# Chessboard Cipher

*Short description:*

This folder contains an implementation of the classical Chessboard/Straddling Checkerboard-style substitution used for compact numeric/text encoding. It demonstrates the algorithmic idea and provides header/source files to integrate into C/C++ projects.

**Implementation:** 

- `C++/Chessboard.h` — primary C++ header for the cipher implementation.

**Notes:**

- The header is written to be integrated into larger programs — adapt the example above to your project's build system.
- See referenced articles on the straddling checkerboard for background and use cases.
