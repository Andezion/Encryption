# Morse Code

*Short description:*

Morse code is a character encoding that represents letters, digits and punctuation using sequences of short and long signals (dots and dashes). It is commonly used for telegraphy and radio communication.

**Implementation:**
- Implementations and tests may be present in C, Rust and C++ subdirectories.

**Algorithm (brief):**

1. Map each character to its Morse representation (dot/dash sequence).
2. For encoding, output the Morse sequences with separators between letters and words.
3. For decoding, parse signal timings or separators to reconstruct characters.

**Example:**

Input: "SOS"
Output: "... --- ..."
