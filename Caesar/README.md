# Caesar Cipher

*Short description:*

The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This repository contains reference implementations and tests in C, C++ and Rust.

**Implementation:** 

- C: Caesar.c, unit test: Caesar_Test.cpp
- C++: Caesar.h, CaesarTest.cpp
- Rust: Caesar_Test.rs, Caesar.rs

**Algorithm (brief):**

Typical usage encrypts or decrypts ASCII alphabetic characters by shifting them with a chosen key (an integer). Non-alphabetic characters are usually left unchanged. To build or run tests, compile the corresponding test files in the language of your choice using your normal build tool or IDE.

**Example:**

Encrypting with shift 3: HELLO -> KHOOR
