# Cardan Grille (Cardan Cipher)

*Short description:*

The Cardan grille is a transposition cipher that uses a perforated mask (the grille) placed over a blank grid. Plaintext is written into the visible cells of the grid; rotating or moving the grille fills the remaining cells. The result is read in a fixed order to produce the ciphertext.

**Implementation:** 

This folder contains a C++ header with an implementation for a one-table Cardan grille:

- C++: CardanOneTable.h

**Algorithm (brief):**

Include the header in your C++ project and use the provided class or functions to create a grille, place plaintext, and produce ciphertext (or reverse the process for decryption). The header implements the core operations for a single-table (one-mask) Cardan grille.
