# Substitution Cipher

*Short description:*

Substitution ciphers replace each symbol in the plaintext with another symbol according to a fixed mapping (monoalphabetic) or multiple mappings (polyalphabetic). They are fundamental manual ciphers and building blocks for more complex schemes.

**Implementation:**
- Implementations and tests may be present in C++ and Rust subdirectories.

**Algorithm (brief):**

1. Define a substitution mapping from plaintext alphabet to ciphertext alphabet.
2. For encoding, replace each plaintext symbol with its mapped symbol.
3. Decoding applies the inverse mapping to recover the plaintext.

**Example:**

Input: "HELLO"
Output: ciphertext produced by applying the substitution mapping (implementation-dependent).
