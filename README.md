Experiments with encryption, information compression and algorithms

## Content
* [AES](#aes) - С/С++
* [ANS](#ans) - 
* [Affine](#affine) - is a special case of the more general monoalphabetic substitution cipher.
* [Atbash](#atbash) - is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher originally used to encrypt the Hebrew alphabet.
* [BWT](#bwt)
* [Caesar](#caesar) - is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
* [Cardan](#cardan)
* [Chessboard](#chessboard)
* [ECC](#ecc)
* [Fleissner](#fleissner)
* [Hill](#hill) - in classical cryptography, the Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.
* [Huffman](#huffman)
* [LZ77](#lz77)
* [LZW](#lzw)
* [MTF](#mtf)
* [Morse](#morse) - is a telecommunications method which encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations.
* [Playfair](#playfair) - is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digram substitution cipher.
* [Polybius](#polybius) - is used for fractionating plaintext characters so that they can be represented by a smaller set of symbols.
* [ROT13](#rot_13) - is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the Latin alphabet.
* [ROT47](#rot_47) - ROT47 is a derivative of ROT13 which, in addition to scrambling the basic letters, treats numbers and common symbols.
* [Scytale](#scytale) - is a tool used to perform a transposition cipher.
* [SHA256](#sha_256)
* [SHA512](#sha_512)
* [Scytale](#scytale)
* [Substitution](#substitution) - is a method of encrypting that creates the ciphertext by replacing units of the plaintext in a defined manner
* [Transposition](#transposition) - is a method of encryption which scrambles the positions of characters without changing the characters themselves.
* [Vigenere](#vigenere) - Each letter is encrypted with a Caesar cipher shifted by the corresponding key letter.
