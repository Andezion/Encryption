## ANS
Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS) is an entropy coding method that combines high compression like arithmetic coding with performance close to bitwise algorithms (e.g., Huffman).
In ANS, a single number stores the entire state, and each symbol is encoded by transitioning from one state to another.
- tANS (table-based ANS) - uses a pre-computed table of transitions for fast encoding and decoding.
- uANS (uniform ANS) - uses mathematical formulae without tables, providing compactness and flexibility.

I will now show you the results of my implementation of the tANS algorithm. If you would like to see the tests and test materials, you can do so [here](https://github.com/Andezion/Encryption/blob/main/ANS/C%2B%2B/tANS_tests.cpp). You can read the code [here](https://github.com/Andezion/Encryption/blob/main/ANS/C%2B%2B/tANS.h), and here are the test results:
